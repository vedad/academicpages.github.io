### Dynamical evolution of exoplanets
A large number of exoplanets are discovered orbiting close to their star, where some are unlikely to have formed originally. Instead, we believe these planets formed further out, but migrated inwards through various migration processes. In my research I try to infer the migration pathways that has led to its present-day orbit by observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect as the planet transits the star. Such observations tell us whether the planet orbits in the same plane and/or direction as the stellar spin, which traces the dynamical history and can distinguish between various formation scenarios.
